#### Aim

This repo aims to present all my recent *project demoes* as well as give some introduction to myself.



#### Implementation

The server is implemented by heroku & express.

* Key words: css3, html5, es6, react, react-router, redux, webpack, nodejs, express, mongodb, heroku, GIT, MVVM, RESTful.

* Express here is responsible for routing to different project demos (not including the routing inside of the project, most of which is dealt by react-route) and provide api when the front end requests for some data.
* Also, express helps to connect MongoDB to CRUD.
* Since I am using free version of heroku, it will automatically sleep if it has been inactive more than 30 minutes, therefore it would take some time to restart the first time you request the web. Also, I set `$heroku ps:scale web=1`, so it only allow one request at a time.
* Projects are all publish version, source codes are allocated at separate repos. Most of them will be SPA.



#### Catalog
