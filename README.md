### project collection

---

This repo aims to present all my recent *project demoes*.

The server is implemented by heroku & express.

* Express here is responsible for routing to different project demos (not including the routing inside of the project, most of which is dealt by react-route) and provide api when the front end requests for some data.
* Besides that, express helps to CRUD.
* Since I am using free version of heroku, I just set web=1.
* Projects are all the publish version. Most of them will be SPA.



All projects demo can be easily accessed by this [link](https://fathomless-sea-85350.herokuapp.com/).
